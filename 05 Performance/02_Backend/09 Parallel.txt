Node.js offers several techniques for parallel processing to improve performance and handle concurrent operations efficiently. Here are some key approaches:

1. Worker Threads:
Worker threads allow you to run JavaScript code in parallel within a single Node.js process[3]. They are ideal for CPU-intensive tasks like:

- Image or video processing
- Complex mathematical calculations
- Machine learning or data analytics algorithms

To use worker threads:

```javascript
const { Worker, isMainThread, parentPort } = require('worker_threads');

if (isMainThread) {
  const worker = new Worker(__filename);
  worker.on('message', (result) => console.log(result));
  worker.postMessage('Start processing');
} else {
  parentPort.on('message', (message) => {
    // Perform CPU-intensive task here
    parentPort.postMessage('Task completed');
  });
}
```

2. Cluster Module:
The Cluster module allows you to create child processes that share a single server port, enabling efficient load balancing for network-oriented applications[3]. It's useful for:

- Web applications handling numerous HTTP requests
- WebSocket servers
- Real-time chat applications

Example:

```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const http = require('http');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;

if (cluster.isMaster) {
  for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) {
    cluster.fork();
  }
} else {
  http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200);
    res.end('Hello World\n');
  }).listen(8000);
}
```

3. Async/Await and Promises:
While not true parallelism, using async/await and Promises can help manage concurrent operations efficiently[2]:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  const [result1, result2] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('url1'),
    fetch('url2')
  ]);
  // Process results
}
```

4. Child Process Module:
For CPU-intensive tasks, you can use the child_process module to spawn separate Node.js processes[1]:

```javascript
const { fork } = require('child_process');

const process = fork('child-script.js');
process.send({ data: 'Start processing' });
process.on('message', (message) => {
  console.log('Received:', message);
});
```

5. Thread Pool:
Node.js uses a thread pool for certain async operations. By default, it has 4 threads, but you can increase this number by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable[5].

When choosing a parallelism technique, consider:
- The nature of your task (I/O-bound vs CPU-bound)
- The scale of your application
- The complexity of inter-process communication required

Remember that while these techniques can significantly improve performance, they also introduce complexity. Use them judiciously and profile your application to ensure you're getting the expected performance benefits[4].
